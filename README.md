# Machine-Learning
## ***Machine-Learning through PBL***

## About ##
This repository is a knowledge base and project base (aside from my colab notebook) that I plan on sharing. Machine learning has many applications and is something I've been interested in for a long time but have not had much time to pursue. I began learning about it first via Udemy ("Machine Learning, Data Science and Deep Learning with Python" - Frank Kane / Sundog Education) and then began thinking of how to apply it in my personal and professional life.

## Projects ##
The projects below represent the ones I plan on pursuing in the near future.

- Cats/Dogs Classifier
- Line Following Robot
- Stock Analyzer
